# thebutton-data
The csv file contains the press history for /r/thebutton.

The csv has two columns:

"press time" - the date and time at which the press happened

"outage press" - whether the press was an automatic press during a site outage to keep the button alive

Outage presses never incurred at a time when the button was truly at risk of expiring, but if you're doing real scientific analysis on these presses, you may choose to discount these presses or otherwise make a note of them.
